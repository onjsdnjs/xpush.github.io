To configure a distributed server environment to handle large traffic, you should consider a lot of things than you thought.

Team leader John Kim has lectured for the distributed server implementation in domestic conferences and seminars. Let's introduce some his lecture including the video.

This is the lecture presented in **DEVIEW 2013**, can be found via [link](http://deview.kr/2013/detail.nhn?topicSeq=23).
It deals with the basic content of the various methods of large-capacity traffic dispersion method that leverages the open source.

#### 2. [Development practices of distributed chat server using the Socket.IO](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/node-js-on-cloud)

This is the lecture presented in **Microsoft Melting Pot Seminar**, The information on socket.io in node.js utilized in XPUSH  development.
Looking at the node.js applications of global service references, share the cases of build distributed server for handling high traffic and what we look to see how to take into account.

Besides that, we have a variety of activities, so that we will share as case, which was announced on related topics occurs.
